# LED Strip IR Remote with Web Interface

This project is created as a assignment for a university.

# Main aim of the project

* Web interface with remote like button layout to control the LED strip

* LED strip is controlled by IR signals genereted by microcontroller

* Small and portable format of the device

# Used parts:

- NodeMCU V2 based on ESP8266-12E

- IR transmitter SFH4550

- 330Î© rezistor

- Any LED Strip that can be controlled by IR remote

- USB cable to program and supply power to microcontroller
